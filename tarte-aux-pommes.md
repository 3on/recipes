# Tarte aux pommes de 'man
_this is a two for the price of one, pate sablée is my favorite pie crust and it's easy to make_

# Pate sablée

## Ingredients
- 250g of flour
- 120g of butter
- 80g of sugar
- 2 yolks (whites can be used to make [financiers](https://github.com/3on/recipes/blob/master/financiers.md))
- 1 table spoon of water or amaretto
- some cinamon of lemon zest

## Steps
* In a bowl, mix the flour and the butter at room temperature and cut into dice

* Once you get a "wet sand" texture, add cinamon, yolks, sugar and amaretto. Knead the dough until it is homogeneous but don't over do it. You should get a ball that is not sticky nor dry.

* Let it rest for a bit in the fridge (while you work on the filling)
