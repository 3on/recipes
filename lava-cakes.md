## Ingredients

_This is for a small batch, 10 or less, I usually do x2 to x4 and froze the dough_
- 100g of 70% chocolate
- 120g of sugar
- 90g of butter
- 3 eggs
- 40g flour
- a fuckload of amaretto

## Steps

1. Melt chocolate and butter
2. Mix eggs and sugar
3. Mix 1 and 2
4. Add the flour
5. Bake at 400F for 5 to 15min. Timing is very variant according to the oven whether or not the dough was frozen and the molds used. You want to take them out before they crak, but not before they started breading a bit.
For the ikea cupcake mold I used, fresh dough is near 7min, frozen a bit over 10min.
