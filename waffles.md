# Rad fluffy Waffle aka for ever growing dough

## Ingredients
- 2 eggs
- 500ml of milk
- vanilla extract
- 75g of butter
- one tablespoon of sugar
- yeast 15g (I usually go fully random there for fun)
- baking powder (only needed if you can't wait for the dough to grow to get some first waffles)


1. Seperate yolks from whites
2. Beat the crap of the white until magic fulyl happens
3. Mix together:
  - yolks
  - milk
  - melted butter
  - yeast and baking powder if you are going for double fun (quick and slow)
  - vanilla extract
  - sugar
  Pro tip to get a smooth batter, use a mixer.
4. Fold the white in snow into the mix
  Pro tip don't ever mix, slowly fold.
