# Rad fluffy waffles
aka for ever growing dough

## Ingredients for n people*
*\*where n is not too big nor too small*
- 2 eggs
- 500ml of milk
- flour 250g
- vanilla extract
- 75g of butter
- one tablespoon of sugar
- yeast 15g (I usually go fully random there for fun)
- baking powder (only needed if you can't wait for the dough to grow to get some first waffles)


## Steps
1. Seperate yolks from whites
2. Beat the crap of the white until magic fulyl happens
3. Mix together:
  - yolks
  - milk
  - melted butter
  - flour
  - yeast and baking powder if you are going for double fun (quick and slow)
  - vanilla extract
  - sugar
  Pro tip to get a smooth batter, use a mixer.
4. Fold the white in snow into the mix
  Pro tip don't ever mix, slowly fold.
