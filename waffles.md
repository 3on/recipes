![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3on/recipes/master/img/gauffres-1.jpg)

## Ingredients for n people*
_where n is not too big nor too small_
- 2 eggs
- 500ml of milk
- flour 250g
- vanilla extract
- 75g of butter
- one tablespoon of sugar
- yeast 15g (I usually go fully random there for fun)
- baking powder (only needed if you can't wait for the dough to grow to get some first waffles)


## Steps
1. Seperate yolks from whites
2. Beat the crap of the white until magic fulyl happens
3. Mix together:
    * yolks
    * milk
    * melted butter
    * flour
    * yeast and baking powder if you are going for double fun (quick and slow)
    * vanilla extract
    * sugar
    _Pro tip: to get a smooth batter, use a mixer._
4. Fold the white in snow into the mix
  _Pro tip: don't ever mix, slowly fold._
