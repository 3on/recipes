![et voila](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3on/recipes/master/img/cookies-5.jpg)

## Ingredients
_Ratio for shit tons (60+) cookies, half for a decent batch_
- 8 cup of flour
- 4 cup of sugar 50/50 brown sugar
- 400 butter (4 stick)
- baking powder, a bit can be forgotten (I think I did batch without just fine)
- 4 eggs
- 500g chocolate chips
- way too much amaretto

## Steps
1. Melt the butter, then mix the eggs with it, can add a bit of salt, I don't because I like it sweet and my butter is always salted.
2. Mix together flour and sugars and the maybe useless baking powder
3. 2 goes into 1 or 1 to 2 if you are into that kind of thing
