## Ingredients
_Ratio for shit tons (60+) cookies_

- way too much amaretto

## Steps
1. Melt the butter, then mix the eggs with it, can add a bit of salt, I don't because I like it sweet and my butter is always salted.
2. Mix together flour and sugars and magical useless bakign powder
3. 2 goes into 1
