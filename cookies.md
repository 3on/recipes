**Ratio for a shit ton like 60+ cookies**

* 8 cup floor
* 4 cup sugar 50/50 brown sugar
* 400 butter (4 stick)
* baking powder, a bit can be forgotten not sure I even care for it that much
* 4 eggs
* 500g chocolate chip
* way too much amaretto

1. Melt the butter, then mix the eggs with it, can add a bit of salt, I don't because I like it sweet and my butter is always salted.
2. Mix together flour and sugars and magical useless bakign powder
3. 2 goes into 1
4. Chop the chocolate and add it to the mix
5. Make les cookies
6. Bake **10min** at 400F, timing is fucking important, more than anything else here.
