_AKA white boy noodles_

## Ingredients
_the mesurement are not scientific, just an order of magnitude_
- butter (half a stick to a stick)
- 3 green onions
- 4 big garlic cloves
- asian egg noodles
- oyster sauce (2 or 3 talbe spoons)
- soy sauce (1 or 2 table spoons)
- sesame oil (1 table spoon)
- parmesan (optional)

## Steps
1. Cut the garlic in very tiny dice, 1mm or so. Slice the green onion in 1 to 2mm slices, don't waste the green part you usually can use 75% of it.
1. Fry green onions and garlic in butter, in a wok or even better, cast iron. You can substitute part of the butter with sesame oil if you want to limit you butter intake (silly).
1. Boil the noodles for 3 minutes *MAXIMUM*, don't over cook them!!! I like to keep them _al dente_, and finish them in butter _spaetzle style_. (dropping Italian and German words here and there, very authentic Asian receipe ðŸ¤£)
1. Fry the noodles to your liking in the wok/skillet. Add more butter (or sesame oil) as needed. Cook as much as you like, I am usually running out of time, but my goal is to at least brown them. Ideally get some to be close to crust a bit. I usually go 50/50 butter oil at that point. 100% works but I get butter conscious by that step, and it's easier to brown/fry at higher temp therefore with oil as butter ain't good for that.
1. I used to use two pans, one for the sauce and one to fry the noodles. But that's silly. Just lower the fire now that you are happy with the noodle fried level. Move the noodles to the edges of the wok/pan, and free the center of the pan for you to work on the sauce.
1. Add the soy sauce and the oyster sauce, if you have not use any sesame oil by now add some. If you have allready, only add some more if needed. I usually mix the sauce with a spatula and then move the noodles back to the middle of the pan to spread the sauce evenly on the noodles. It's easier to start with a spatula to mix the sauce and finish mixing the noodles with tongs
1. Optionally, you can add parmesan once serving.
