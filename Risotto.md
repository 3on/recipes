# Risotto de la mer

## Ingredients
- Bell pepper
- Corn
- Mushrooms
- Oignons
- Spinach
- Crab or lobster
- Salmon or shrimps
- Better than bouillon lobster (maybe the fish one is good too, never tried)
- Arborio rice
- Parmesan
- Crema
- White wine
- Chipotle spicy sauce

## Rice cooking
It's all about making someone stir for an hour and pourring more bouillon/water.
Bouillons can be super salty, be aware of that and switch to water if needed.

## The rest
I's all about the crunchiness.
Cooking everything in the same pan for an hours will get everything to me mushy, it won't be bad but nowhere near are yummy as trying to preserve crunchyness.
Start with oignons and then mushrooms, add creama wine and some chipotle sauce and spinach. Those can be over cooked to mush, whatever.
Corn, bell pepper and the meat must be cooked sepratly and added last minute to preserve crunchyness
