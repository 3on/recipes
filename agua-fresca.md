# Simple agua fresca

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3on/recipes/master/img/agua-fresca-1.jpg)

## Ingredients for a pitcher
_for a thicker than not agua fresca_
- half a pinapple (could be replace with Watermelon I guess, I never tried I dislike that shit)
- fresh mint, 3 branches
- Secondary fruit(s) _you can add multiples_
  - strawberries (6+)
  - peaches (2 or 3)
  - raspberry (tasty but filtering is a bit more annoying)
  - black berries (same)
  - kiwi (3+, can result in a bitter beverage by itself)
  - pomegranate (tasty, but an insane amount of work, I gave up. Taking it apart and filtering is so tedious, peaches are just as tasty to me)
  - mango (not the easiest to cut/mix)

_I tried many combo, and so far the best result has been strawberies or peach. Some 3 fruits combo work great but 2 seems better_

## Steps
1. Slice the half pinapple and other fruit. For the peaches I used to remove the sking, it's extra work but makes filtering easier. But I think you get a better result with the skin anyway (more flavor).
1. I am a sucker for an immersion blender, so that's what I use, but a blender works too. Mix the fruit with some cold water, don't use more than half the volume of the pitcher you want to use.
1. Filter the mix into a pitcher using a strainer, that's the most annoying part. The way I had more succes is to use a lid or ice crean spoon to scrap/press the pulpe on the strainer.
1. Add water to fill up the pitcher.
1. Add the mint to the pitcher and let it rest/cool over night. You can remove the mint the next morning if you do not want the mint flavor to be too present.
