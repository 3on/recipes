_even easier with a pressure cooker_


# Ingredients
- boeuf stew chunks, the less lean the better
- 3 to 5 carrotes
- a bunch of tiny balls potatoes
- 1 onion
- bacon (3+ thick slice)
- mushrooms (2,3 cup of shrooms)
- bouquet garni or french herbs

_Pro tip: use a different pan than the dutch oven or pressure cooker you will use to prevent later sticking burns_
2. Dice the onion and slice the mushrooms, saut√© them with butter too, you can throw some herbesd e provence in there.
3. Put #2 in the dutch oven or even better pressure cooker, add the potatoes and the peeled and cut in chunks carottes. Add the meat. Submerge with liquid, red wine and stock to your liking. If you use a pressure cooker you wonn't loose any liquid so you can use 100% 2 bucks chuck (maybe 2/3 of a bottle). If you use a dutch oven or alike you will need to poor somestock when needed. Don't forget to add a bouquet garni or some herbes de provences.
4. Cook for as long as you can. With a pressure cooker, bring it to pressure on medium then leave it on low for 1hour+. With a tradition dutch oven, pay attention to the liquid level, add when needed and be careful to not burn the bottom, keep the fire low for 3h+.
5. If you use a pressure cooker you might have a result that is more liquid than you'd want. To fix this, just make a quick roux (butter + corn starsh) in a sauce pan then add some of the stew bouillon to it and whisk it. You should get a smooth thick gravy that you can use instead of the stew bouillon.
